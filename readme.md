A Unity space lander game created in Feb-March 2021

This is a very complex game revolving around space landers. Careful movement and attention to instruments is required to properly fly the lander.
And the goal of the game is to maneuver the lander around obstacles and terrain to reach the landing zones. Overall, it's a nice game for space-enthusiasts.
